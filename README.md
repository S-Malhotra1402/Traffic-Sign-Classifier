# Traffic-Sign-Classifier

The goal of this project is to build a CNN in TensorFlow to classify traffic sign images from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

Main steps are:
1. dataset exploration and visualization
2. data augmentation
3. deep network design and training
4. visualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions

Importing and Classifying the signs

On running a test case , the  Test accuracy comes out to be  0.9676167964935303 and the sign is recognised correctly
